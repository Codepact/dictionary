# Clickwrap agreement

A clickwrap agreement is a form of contract where a perosn indicates their agreement by checking a tickbox. We often see clickwrap agreements when we create accounts for online services. Before we can confirm the account, we have to click on a box next to a statement saying something like: "I agree to the terms and conditions and the privacy policy".

It is helpful, when using these pithy statements, to link to the documents that are being agreed to. In the example above, the words "terms and conditions" and "privacy policy" would link to the relevant documents.
