# Personal Information

In the context of privacy law, personal information is any information or opinion about:
- an identified individual; or
- an individual who is reasonably identifiable (from the infromation).

Examples include an individualâ€™s name, signature, address, telephone number, date of birth, medical records, bank account details, employment details and commentary or opinion about a person.

If information is de-identified it will no longer count as personal information. Note: it is hard to properly de-idenfify information, because it is easy to cross reference information online and find out individuals' identity.
