# Work Specification

A work specification is a document that describes the work that will be performed under a contract. It is sometimes called a _Work Scope_ or _Statement of Work_.  

In a _Software Development Agreement_, the work specification might describe the functionality of the application that the developer will deliver to the customer.

**How it works**

A work specification becomes part of an agreement when the agreement refers to it for information.

You will often encounter documentation where the "separation of concerns" is:

- commercial detail (payment amounts, technical specifications of services etc) is described in the work specification; and
- legal concepts like claim limits and indemnities that form part of the deal are handled in the agreement.

**Work specification example**

Here's an example of how an agreement and work specification would work together on the topic of payment. 

The agreement would have a 'Payment Calculation' clause which refers to the work specification:

>The fees payable to Provider in exchange for the Services will be calculated at the rate or rates set out in the Work Specification.

The work specification document would then set out payment rates, for example in a table like this:

>|  Work type      |  Rate (per day) |
>|-----------------|-----------------|
>| UX Design       | $400            |
>| Software design | $600            |
>| Web design      | $300            |
