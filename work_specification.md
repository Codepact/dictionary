# Work Specification

A work specification is a document or set of documents that describes work that will be performed under a contract. It is sometimes called a **Work Scope** or **Statement of Work**.

The work specification may also be set out in an order or order form.

Whatever form a work specifiation takes, it usually goes hand in hand with a set of terms and conditions, like our Simple Services Agreement. The work specification deals with the practical details of the work, and sometimes things like payment terms and expenses policies. The terms and conditions deal with legal issues like indmenities and claim limits.
