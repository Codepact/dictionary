# AU Privacy notification statement

### What is a notification statement?

Under Australian privacy law, if you are the kind of business that requires a privacy policy, you also need to take reasonable steps notify individuals when you collect their informaiton.

This can be done with a notification statement.

### Where to put a notification statement?

Notification statements may appear:
- as a popup when people navigate to a website or app; and/or
- at the end of online forms where individuals enter personal information like names, email addresses, and payment information.

### What should a notification statement look like?

**Minimalist approach**

Some businesses use a minimalist approach, requiring users to click a checkbox next to a statement like this

>*I agree to the __terms and conditions__ and the __privacy policy__.*

The statement typically contains links to the privacy policy and terms of use.

**Best practice**

Best practice is to have a notification statement containing more details about how you collect, use, and disclose personal infromation.

See the Codepact templates page for an example notification statement.
