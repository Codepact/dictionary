# AU Notification statement

### What is a notification statement?

Under Australian privacy law, if you are the kind of business that requires a privacy policy, you also need to take reasonable steps notify individuals when you collect their informaiton.

This can be done with a notification statement.

### Where to put a notification statement?

Notification statements may appear:
- as a popup when people navigate to the entity's website or app; and/or
- at the end of online forms where individuals enter personal information like names, email addresses, and payment information.

### What should a notification statement look like?

**Minimalist approach**

Some businesses use a minimalist approach, requiring users to click a checkbox next to a statement like this

>*I agree to the __terms and conditions__ and the __privacy policy__.*

The statement typically contains links to the privacy policy and terms of use.

**Best practice**

Best practice is to have a notification statement like the following. Feel free to use this as a template.

>*[Insert business name] collects the personal information that you provide to us. This includes: [describe instances when individuals give personal information to the provider]. We collect the following kinds of sensitive information:
>[insert list of sensitive information collected].

>We collect this information in order to be able to provide our services to you, and to inform you about them. [Add information about main uses or disclosures].

>We are not required by law to collect this information, but without it, we cannot provide our services. Our handling of personal information may involve storage and processing of data overseas.  For more about:
>- the information we collect;
>- how me manage and disclose it[, including overseas data management; and
>- who to contact if you have questions or complaints regarding privacy,
>please see our __privacy policy__ [insert privacy policy link or url].*
